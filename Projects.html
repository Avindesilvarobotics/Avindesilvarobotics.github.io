  <p>Total redesign of the car. Rather than focusing on the car's shape and reucing air resistance, the focus of this new design was to get as much acceleration as possible. This was done by adding as much weight to the car as one could through the use of a heavy block of wood with multiple metals strung inside of it. The new mass of the car came in to be about 430g, which is nearing the 1 pound weight limit. The current issue with this car is the wheels, as they're not exactly round and not smooth. The current time for this car to reach the bottom of the track is 4.2s, as it begins to slow down very early due to the inability to keep its momentum.</p>

  <p>This is the first iteration of the derby car that we chose to go with. The body was slim and lightweight, with most of the weight being in the front of the car. The body itself along with the axles weighed in at about 200g, which we found was rather light. The body is long but not too narrow, and with the size of the wheels designed, it was expected for the car to have plenty of clearance from the bottom of the track as it would roll down. However, in later testing we found that even though the design was cool in concept, there simply wasn't enough weight nor was there room on the axles to add weight via bearings.</p>
